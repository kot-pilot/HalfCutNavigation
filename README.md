Half cut navigation is the additional way to navigate through file text with key shortcuts. Most users utilize 'home' (move caret to line start), 'end' (move caret to line end),
Ctrl + → (move caret to next word right), Ctrl + ← (move caret to next word left).

Half cut navigation adds additional commands like: 
'half-cut line right' (which means move caret half of the way from current position to line right end) 
'half-cut line left' (which means move caret half of the way from current position to line left end) 

For now plans are to create Visual studio and VS Code extensions, which will provide such commands.
